Data Structures and Algorithms in Java

Features:
- **AVL Tree:** A self-balancing binary search tree that maintains sorted data.
- **Min Heap:** A complete binary tree that allows extracting the minimum element efficiently.
- **Dijkstra’s Algorithm:** An algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph.
- **Multithreading:** Demonstration of concurrency with Java’s `ExecutorService`.

How to Run:
- Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/akhilavunnam1/Data-Structures-Algorithms.git`
- Compile and run the Java files.

Time Complexity Analysis:
- **AVL Tree:** O(log n) for insertion, deletion, and search.
- **Min Heap:** O(log n) for insertion and removal.
- **Dijkstra’s Algorithm:** O(V^2) or O(E log V) using a priority queue.
